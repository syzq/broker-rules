  Canonical source data using a rule-set syntax compatible with Surge, Shadowrocket, and Loon.
- [rule/Surge/Broker/Broker.list](./rule/Surge/Broker/Broker.list)
- [rule/Shadowrocket/Broker/Broker.list](./rule/Shadowrocket/Broker/Broker.list)
- [rule/Loon/Broker/Broker.list](./rule/Loon/Broker/Broker.list)
- [rule/QuantumultX/Broker/Broker.list](./rule/QuantumultX/Broker/Broker.list)

## Usage

This repository is published at `syzq/broker-rules`.

### Surge

```ini
[Proxy Group]
Broker = select, HK-Fixed-IP, US-Fixed-IP

[Rule]
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/Surge/Broker/Broker.list,Broker
```

### Shadowrocket

```ini
[Rule]
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/Shadowrocket/Broker/Broker.list,Broker
```

### Loon

```ini
[Rule]
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/Loon/Broker/Broker.list,Broker
```

### Quantumult X

```ini
[filter_remote]
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/QuantumultX/Broker/Broker.list, tag=Broker, force-policy=Broker, enabled=true
```

Notes:

- The Quantumult X file already uses `Broker` as the policy name.
- If you want a different policy name, edit the third column in the file or rely on `force-policy`.

### Clash

```yaml
rule-providers:
  broker:
    type: http
    behavior: classical
    url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/Clash/Broker/Broker.yaml
    path: ./ruleset/broker.yaml
    interval: 86400

rules:
  - RULE-SET,broker,Broker
```

### Stash

```yaml
rule-providers:
  broker:
    type: http
    behavior: classical
    url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syzq/broker-rules/main/rule/Stash/Broker/Broker.yaml
    path: ./ruleset/broker.yaml
    interval: 86400

rules:
  - RULE-SET,broker,Broker
```

## Sources

This ruleset fully incorporates the relevant brokerage entries from the following upstream rule sources:

- `koo17173/rule-set`
  - full `futu.list`
  - full `longbridge` section from `Stocks.list`
  - all 3 additional Futu IP entries from the `futu` section in `Stocks.list`
- `blackmatrix7/ios_rule_script`
  - full `TigerFintech.list`
  - community update proposal in issue `#1687` for Futu, Moomoo, Longbridge, and Tiger Brokers

On top of those upstream datasets, this repository adds official domains used by quote delivery, Level 2 data, OpenAPI, login flows, and support centers, plus observable entry IPs captured on `20[...]

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the maintainers of the upstream rule projects, especially `koo17173/rule-set` and `blackmatrix7/ios_rule_script`. Their existing work provided the baseline coverage that made this [...]

## Maintenance Notes

- Prefer domain-based matching as the primary routing method. `IP-CIDR` entries are best treated as supplemental coverage.
- Charles Schwab currently relies heavily on CDN edge delivery, so domain rules are more stable than hard-coded CDN IPs.
- Longbridge and Tiger Brokers both use dedicated quote, trade, and OpenAPI endpoints for market data and Level 2 flows, so website-only coverage is usually not enough.
- If you want to expand this repository later, consider splitting additional providers such as Huatai, East Money, or Tonghuashun into separate rule-sets to keep the scope clean.
